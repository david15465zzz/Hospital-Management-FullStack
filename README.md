# Hospital-Management-Fullstack

   The website was built with java, spring boot, hibernate, react(type script), redux, mongoDB and docker. The website gives a hospital information about the number of employees, doctors, nurses who work within it and patients who get treated
          You can edit them, add, delete, and of course see them all. There is a thread that runs and deletes patients who are no longer in treatment.
